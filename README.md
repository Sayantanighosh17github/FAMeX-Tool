FAMex Tool - Feature Association Map based Explainibility Tool provides scores to the features of a dataset given as input. 
It calculates the feature criticality score based on the similarity/redundancy and relevancy of the features and returns a set of features with their score of importance.  
To validate this score, classifiers like SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes are used on the newly formed feature set of FAMeX to determine how accurately FAMeX has ranked the features based on the scores.
